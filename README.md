# MultidimCS
This is an EE student project (Bsc)
An attempt to conduct CS (compressed sensing) on multiple sensors of the same kind measuring at the same time.
This problem differs from the regular CS pardigm because the signals are neither sparse nor compressible by themselves. 
We assume the sparsity of the problem arises from the fact that the signals are inherently similar to one another.

We propose novel approch to pre-process the data, utilize the correlation between the signal, to get efficient compression with very low distortion (MSE) on a relevant toy example.
